# diffpy_recipes

This repository contains several examples of diffpy-cmi recipes for pdf refinement of clusters or nanoparticles. 
Structures can be of cluster type (e.g. xyz format) or described by cif files + form factor.

All those recipes are strongly inspired by the book "PDF to the people" written by Prof. S.J.L. Billinge. ( see rep.  https://github.com/Billingegroup/pdfttp_data)
Note that the comments in the code haven't been checked or updated. The may therefore be misadatapted in some places.
